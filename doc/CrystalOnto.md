# CrystalOnto

Here we document the ontology CrystalOnto. This ontology captures the crystallographic information about different crystal systems, space groups, point groups, notations such as Pearson symbol, Strukturbericht notation and Schoenflies notation. This information is then linked with the tensorial nature of different physical properties so that we can use the Neumann principle to comment on the number of terms required for such properties.
