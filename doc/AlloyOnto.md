# AlloyOnto

Here we documentat the ontology AlloyOnto.

AlloyOnto will capture names of alloys, the specification in terms of elements and their compositions. It will eventually get links to the phases the alloys contain and different crystallographic aspects of those phases. The concept of Alloys will be extended to also represent alloy systems so that information on the equilibrium reactions can also be represented.
